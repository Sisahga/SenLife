                <p>The elderly population often faces a disparity between their lifespan and healthspan, underscoring the necessity for technologies that enhance their well-being. However, current technologies often lack adaptability and elder-friendly designs, impeding their acceptance and usage among this demographic.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Despite a growing proficiency among many elderly individuals in using mobile devices and exploring new technologies, the existing solutions fail to adequately meet their needs. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the need for technologies supporting the well being of the elderly, particularly during periods of social distancing and isolation.</p>

                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>To address these challenges, our design company, Flying Turtles, is developing an app tailored to support the physical and mental well-being of elderly users. This solution, which is focused in simplicity, incorporates big buttons and checklists for ease of use, offers virtual assistance to address technical and health-related issues, provides wellness reminders for activities like walking and hydration, notifies users about local activities, catered to the elderly, and includes a news section curated for their interests and needs.
